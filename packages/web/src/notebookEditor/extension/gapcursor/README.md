# GapCursor

This extension loads the ProseMirror GapCursor Plugin, which adds a gap for the cursor in places that don't allow regular selection. For example, at the start or the end of the document. The cursor needs CSS to show up (via the ProseMirror-gapcursor class).

The GapCursor Plugin from ProseMirror must be registered in TipTap so that it can be used. Hence the existence of this extension.
